## App Structure

This Flutter project is structured around several templates and components that make up the UI of the app. The main components include:

- ## Widgets

- ### Product Info Container
- Displays detailed information about a specific product, including its image, description, price, and a button to add it to the cart.

class ProductInfoContainer extends StatelessWidget {
  final String url;
  final String productName;
  final String description;
  final String productPrice;
  final Function()? onPressedbuy;
  final bool isFavorite;
  final Function()? onPressedFavorite;
  // constructor and build method...
}

- ### Cart Template
- Shows the user's shopping cart with a list of added products. It provides options to remove or add quantities to items in the cart, and displays the total amount to be paid.

class CartTemplate extends StatelessWidget {
  final bool authentication;
  final List<dynamic> listCart;
  final String totalToPay;
  // constructor and build method...
}

- ### Home Template
- The home screen of the app, where users can browse through different product categories, view a list of products, and add products to their favorites or cart.

class HomeTamplate extends StatelessWidget {
  final bool isLogIn;
  final List<dynamic> products;
  final String? errorMessage;
  final bool isLoading;
  final List<dynamic> myFavoriteList;
  final List<dynamic> myCartList;
  final String selectedCategory;
  // constructor and build method...
}

- ### Home Template
- Handles the user login flow, including text fields for username and password and a button to submit the credentials.

class LoginTemplate extends StatelessWidget {
  final bool? isLoadingButton;
  final VoidCallback? cartonPressed;
  // constructor and build method...
}

- ### Product Template
- Displays a product's detailed information in a separate screen, including its image, price, and description. The user can add the product to the cart or mark it as a favorite.

class ProductTemplate extends StatelessWidget {
  final bool isFavorite;
  final VoidCallback? cartonPressed;
  final VoidCallback? backonPressed;
  // constructor and build method...
}

- ### User Template
- Shows the user's profile information, such as their name, email, phone, and address. Users can log out, view their cart, or navigate back to the previous screen.

class UserTemplate extends StatelessWidget {
  final VoidCallback? backonPressed;
  final VoidCallback? cartonPressed;
  final VoidCallback? logOutonPressed;
  final String lastName;
  final String name;
  final String username;
  // constructor and build method...
}
