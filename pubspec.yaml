flutter:

# To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
# assets:
#   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
#   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
#
# For details regarding assets in packages, see
# https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
#
# An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
# https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
# To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
# in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# example:
  fonts:
      - family: Roboto
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf

      - family: OpenSans
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Light.ttf

      - family: Karla
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/Karla-Regular.ttf
